	<h2>Background</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Section 232 Tariffs
		</li>
		<li>
			The EU Safeguard measure
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		EU and US want to settle trade war.

	<h2>TBD</h2>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Section 232 tariffs</h2>

	<section>
		On 23 March 2018, US tariffs of 25% on steel imports
		and 10% on aluminium imports took effect.
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Reasons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Domestic steel & aluminium production
			is essential for national security applications.</li>
			<li>Imports in such quantities as are presently found adversely
			impact the economic welfare of the U. S. steel & aluminium industry.</li>
		</ul>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				Too heavy steel and aluminium imports impair US national security.
				I am going to illustrate this just about steel.
				The case for aluminium is similar.
			</p>
			<p>
				National security includes projected national defense requirements for the U.S. Department of Defense.
				National security also encompasses U.S. critical infrastructure sectors
				including transportation systems, the electric power grid, water systems, and energy generation systems.
				Domestic steel production is essential for national security applications.
				Statutory provisions illustrate that Congress believes
				domestic production capability is essential for defense requirements and critical infrastructure needs,
				and ultimately to the national security of the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides, excessive steel imports have adversely impacted the steel industry.
				Numerous U.S. steel mill closures, a substantial decline in employment,
				and lost domestic sales and market share
				illustrate the decline of the U.S. steel industry.
				As steel imports have increased, U.S. steel production capacity
				has been stagnant and production has decreased.
				The declining steel capacity utilization rate is not economically sustainable.
				Utilization rates of 80 percent or greater are necessary to sustain adequate profitability
				and continued capital investment, research and development,
				and workforce enhancement in the steel sector.
			</p>
			<p>
				Largely, this situation is caused by the rapid increase in the production capacity of China.
				China subsidizes its steel and aluminum industry,
				which leads to an increase of world supply for those goods.
				This is not closely related to our topic today,
				and I will not talk further about it.

		<h3>Effects</h3>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				We can illustrate the effect of the tariffs by using the diagram.
			</p>
			<p>
				... (domestic effects)
			</p>
			<p>
				This tariff also leads to a decrease in the demand for steel and aluminium in the world market.
			</p>
			<p>
				... (international effects)
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, EU worse off and US better off.
				Therefore,
				EU wants an end to Section 232 tariffs,
				but the US rather not.
			</p>

		<h3>What if the Section 232 Tariffs are abolished?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Reverting back to the situation before Section 232.</li>
			<li>EU may (but probably not) soon withdraw the Safeguard measure.</li>
			<li>The advantage would clearly be on the EU side.</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				So, what will happen if the EU and the US reach an agreement on November 1?
				Actually, that depends on what the EU and the US agree on.
				If the US government makes changes to Section 232 as a result of the negotiations,
				then according to a clause in a regulation of EU,
				there would have to be an immediate review of Safeguard by the Europeans.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, what will happen if the Section 232 tariffs are abolished?
			</p>
			<p>
				If the United States unilaterally abolishes its Section 232 tariffs,
				this would revert the situation back to when there were no such tariffs,
				which means this would open the door for EU steel imports into the United States.
				But U.S. steel exports would still fall
				under the quota rules and tariffs of the EU Safeguard measure,
				and will until the European Commission decides that a Safeguard review has found that
				EU steelmakers remain safe –
				which is more likely not to be the case.
				And the import quota of U.S. steel mills to Europe is not that large now.
				The advantage would clearly be on the EU side.

	<h2>A quota system</h2>
	<section>
		<h3>Reasons</h3>
		<p>
			As US limited the import, EU has to respond to this change, decreasing their import as well, or their net export will be lowered, causing a decrease in domestic AD.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Effects of quota</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Increase in quality supplied, decrease in quantity demanded and decrease in imports.
			</li>
			<li>
Domestic consumers are worse off.
</li><li>
Domestic producers are better off.
</li><li>
Domestic employment increases.
</li><li>
Domestic income distribution worsens.
</li><li>
Increased inefficiency in production.
</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>If canceled</h3>
		<p>US is highly possible to keep Section 232, limiting import. This way, EU worse off in net export.</p>
	</section>

<section>
	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>
		No real solutions have yet been proposed and it will be very difficult to find them.
