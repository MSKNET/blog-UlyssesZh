# Dododo

A rhythm game with musical rhythm notations!

Get access to the game through [the webpage](https://ulysseszh.github.io/rpg/dododo/).

## How to play

There are 3 ways in which you can start playing,
each of which starts with providing the game with a **beatmap** (or chart).

### Playing through uploading files

You need to upload a beatmap from your file system.

You can also specify an audio file for the music.
If there is no audio file specified, the game will use that specified by
[`audioUrl`](#audiourl) in the [head](#head) of the beatmap.

### Playing through browsing the store

The function is *under development*.

There will be a store (under development) for beatmappers to publish their beatmaps.

### Playing through selecting from history

The function is *under development*.

## How to adjust beatmap offset

Sometimes, you may find that the music and the beatmap is not perfectly synchronized.
In this case, you need to set a universal offset to cancel this effect.

To set a universal offset, select "Offset wizard" in the preferences.
Then, you will start playing a very simple beatmap.
Just feel the rhythm by your heart and hit the spacebar.
After you finish playing the beatmap, the game will adjust the offset automatically for you.
If you are not satisfied with the new offset, you can repeat these steps.

Alternatively, you can set the offset without using the offset wizard.
You can directly set it in the preferences.

## Game mechanics

In this section, a detailed illustration of the process of gameplay is delivered.

### Notes

**Note**s are the most essential part of the gameplay.

There are two types of notes in Dododo, **click**s and **hold**s.

To hit a note, you should hit a key on the keyboard (on a device with a keyboard)
or touch the screen (on a device with a touchable screen)
within the time at which it should be hit (when the [judge line](#judge-line) meets the note)
plus or minus the inaccuracy tolerance.

There are three levels of inaccuracies: perfect, good, and bad.
Their judge intervals are to be specified in the beatmap and can change throughout the gameplay.
If a note fails to be hit, it is a miss judge.
The number of perfects, goods, bads, and misses affect
the [score](#score) and the [accuracy rate](#accuracy-rate).

Specially, to hit a hold, throughout its sustaining time
(until its end time minus the inaccuracy tolerance of good judge),
there should be at least one key/touch being pressed.
If there are multiple holds sustaining at the same time,
there should also be multiple keys/touches being pressed at the same time.

At first, notes are colored white (the color can be customized in preferences).
After a note is cleared (hit or missed), the note will be re-colored.
Perfect is yellow; good is blue; bad is green; miss is red (the colors can be customized in preferences).
After a note is hit, there will appear an indicator in the [inaccuracy bar](#inaccuracy-bar).

If a hit cannot correspond to any notes, it is regarded as an excess hit,
which also affects the [score](#score), the [accuracy rate](#accuracy-rate), and the [combo](#combo).

### Bar lines

**Bar line**s are vertical lines as auxiliaries for reading the beatmap.
They are an imitation of bar lines from sheet music.
They can also be used to ornament the beatmap.
They themselves do not affect the gameplay.

### Judge line

The **judge line** (or scan line) moves throughout the gameplay.
The perfect time for the player to hit a note is exactly
when the judge line moves to a position at the center of the note.

The speed of the judge line can change throughout the gameplay,
and it can even run from right to the left.

### Inaccuracy bar

The **inaccuracy bar** is to help indicate how inaccurate the notes are hit.
It is located at the bottom of the gameplay interface.
It is colored symmetrically, with the perfect judge interval being yellow,
the good judge interval being blue, and the bad judge interval being green
(the colors can be customized in preferences).
Note that the inaccuracy tolerances are specific to different beatmaps,
and it can even change during the gameplay.

When a note is hit, according to the inaccuracy,
a small rule will appear at the inaccuracy bar.
The more early it is hit, the more left the small rule will be to.
The small rule then fades out.
With an exact perfect hit, the small rule will appear at the very center of the inaccuracy bar.

Any inaccuracy out of the bad judge interval
will not cause a small rule to appear at the inaccuracy bar.

### Combo

The **combo** refers to the number of consecutive notes the player hits.
It is shown in the bottom-left corner of the gameplay interface.

There are two cases when the combo is interrupted and reset to 0:

- During the time at which a note should be hit plus or minus the good judge interval,
the note is not hit. In other words, a note is badded or missed.
- A key that can possibly be the key of a note is hit mistakenly.
In other words, during the time at which a key is hit plus or minus the bad judge interval,
there are no notes corresponding to the key.

After a gameplay is finished, an FC (full combo) note will appear next to the combo number
if the combo has never been reset during the gameplay.

### Accuracy rate

The **accuracy rate** is set based on your performance in playing a beatmap.
The accuracy rate is shown dynamically during the gameplay
in the bottom-right corner of the gameplay interface.
The calculation of the accuracy rate is
```js
AccuracyRate = (perfect + good/4 - excess) / (perfect + good + bad + miss);
```

### Score

The game will assign you a **score** based on your performance in playing a beatmap.
The score is shown dynamically during the gameplay, just like the accuracy rate,
at the up-right corner of the gameplay interface.
The calculation of the score involves the number of perfects, goods, bads, misses, and excesses:

```js
Score = 1000000 * (perfect + good/4 - excess) / notesCount;
```

Unlike some (or most) rhythm games, Dododo does not take combo into account when scoring.

Once a gameplay is finished (the judge line reaches the end of the beat map),
a mark will be calculated and shown in the bottom-right corner of the gameplay interface.
The mark is a letter. The mark scale is

| Mark | Score      |
|------|------------|
| P    | = 1000000  |
| S    | \>= 950000 |
| A    | \>= 900000 |
| B    | \>= 800000 |
| C    | \>= 700000 |
| D    | \>= 600000 |
| E    | \>= 500000 |
| F    | else       |

The mark is also shown dynamically next to the accuracy rate during the gameplay
based on your performance so far.
There is a simple relation between the accuracy rate and the score when the gameplay has been finished:
```js
Score == 1000000 * AccuracyRate;
```

## How to compose a beatmap

A Dododo beatmap is a `.ddd` file in plain-text format.
The beatmap consists of two parts, the **head** and the list of **row**s.
The two parts are separated by a single `---` line.

The following are just some specifications.

### Header

The header consists of several key-value pairs, each of which lies in a line,
and a key is separated from its corresponding value by `: ` (a colon and a whitespace).

The following items are available:

#### `title`

The name of the music.

This item should always be specified to a simple, short, unique, direct string
so that users can identify the music quickly.

#### `musicAuthor`

The author of the music (the artist).

The first name and middle name of the author can
be abbreviated as their initial letters for brevity.
If there are multiple authors,
it is recommended to specify them all and connect the names with `&`.
If multiple authors contribute in different ways to composing the music
(composers, lyricists, players, etc.),
it is recommended to specify such information in parentheses.
For example, `W. A. Mozart (Composer) & S. Ligoratti (Player)`.

#### `beatmapAuthor`

The author of the beatmap.

You may use your nickname.

#### `difficulty`

The difficulty of the beatmap.

It is usually specified as an integer ranging from 1 to 15.
If it is not specified, the difficulty would be "unknown" (without the quotes).
Though not recommended, you can specify the difficulty as
numbers greater than 15 or "???" for extremely hard beatmaps.

Difficulty is intended to be a brief indicator on an ordinal scale
of how hard the beatmap is to beat.

#### `audioUrl`

The url of the audio file of the music.

If it is not specified, the user has to upload an audio file
(if playing through uploading files),
or the user will not hear any music when playing.

#### `start`

Where to start playing the audio file, in milliseconds.

If it is not specified, the audio file will be played from its very beginning.

In some cases, the audio file used as the music is too long for a rhythm game,
and it cannot be modified easily if it is provided through a url.
Then, you may have to specify a certain portion (segment) of the audio file.
The items `start` and [`end`](#end) offers you the function.

#### `end`

Where to end playing the audio file, in milliseconds.

If it is not specified, the audio file will be played until its very end.
Despite that, you should always specify this item in your beatmap
to prevent the game preloading the metadata of the audio file
(for calculating the length) to increase its performance.

#### `volume`

The volume for playing the audio file. `1.0` means original volume.

It is intended to be used when the audio file is provided through a url
because the file cannot be modified in that case.

#### `offset`

The time (position) in the played audio at which the beatmap starts.
May be negative or positive.

It is different from `start` in that the audio before `offset` will be played.
Note that, if `start` and `offset` are both specified,
audio starts playing at `start` while the beatmap starts at `start + offset`.

### Rows

Different **row**s in the beatmap are separated by an empty line.
Do not include empty lines within a row.

Every row consists of one or several **voice**s.
Each voice consists of several **note**s and **bar line**s and is written within a line.
Every note is specified by its note length and multiplicity (simultaneous note in the same voice)
together with symbols denoting whether the note is hold, tied, beamed, etc.

#### Control sentences

Before specifying the notes in a row, some control sentences can be included for the row.
Each control sentence includes a function name and one or more parameters,
separated by spaces.
The function name must start with a capitalized letter, and the rest letters are case-insensitive.

Here is some function names and the corresponding parameters.

##### `PERFECT`, `GOOD`, `BAD`

Syntax:

```text
PERFECT <interval>
GOOD <interval>
BAD <interval>
```

These control sentences accept one parameter, indicating the judging interval.
The `interval` is NOT in milliseconds but is the ratio of the tolerance for a perfect / good / bad judge
and the total (temporal) length of the row.
Therefore, judging will be stricter if the row is shorter (in time).

##### `BPM`

Syntax:

```text
BPM <beatNote1> <beatsPerMinute1>[ <position1>[ <beatNote2> <beatsPerMinute2> <position2>[ ... ]]]
```

The `beatNote` is a note specified in the same manner in [how to write a note](#how-to-write-a-note).
The `beatsPerMinute` is the number of beats per minute,
meaning that one minute is exactly `beatsPerMinute` times as long as the beat note.
The `position` is the position of the BPM change, specified as a rational number in [0, 1],
with the start of the row being 0 and the end of the row being 1.
The position is calculated according to notes' literal length but not their temporal length
(e.g. a quavar in 180 BPM and one in 200 BPM has the same literal length because they are both quavars).

##### `MS_PER_WHOLE`

Syntax:

```text
MS_PER_WHOLE <millisecondsPerWhole>
```

This sets the average temporal length of a whole note in milliseconds.
Usually this can be automatically calculated by the game according to the BPM specified by [`BPM`](#bpm),
or inherit from last row.
However, sometimes it is necessary to specify it manually, especially when using [`TIME`](#time).

##### `TIME`

Syntax:

```text
TIME <expression>
```

Here `<expression>` is a single-variable mathematical expression of variable `x`.
See [math expressions](#math-expressions).

The expression is a mapping from [0, 1] to [0, 1].
It *must* be monotonically increasing (because you cannot travel to the past).
It maps the position in the row to the time at which the position in the row is played.
The position mapped to 0 is played exactly when the row starts being played,
and the position mapped to 1 is played exactly when the row ends being played
(and when the next row starts being played).
For example, with the expression `sqrt(x)` you can have the tempo linearly
(w.r.t. notes' literal lengths) increasing from 0.

Default: `x`.

##### `SPACE_X`

Syntax:

```text
SPACE_X <expression>
```

Here `<expression>` is a single-variable mathematical expression of variable `x`.
See [math expressions](#math-expressions).

The expression is a mapping from [0, 1] to [0, 1].
It maps the position ion the row to the spatial position.
The position mapped to 0 is drawn at the leftmost place,
and the position mapped to 1 is drawn at the rightmost place.
It is not necessarily monotonically increasing (to possibly make the judge line move to the left)
or being continuous (to possibly make the judge line jump suddenly).

Default: `x`.

##### `SPACE_Y`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`

Syntax:

```text
SPACE_Y <expression>
WIDTH <expression>
HEIGHT <expression>
```

Here `<expression>` is a single-variable mathematical expression of variable `x`.
See [math expressions](#math-expressions).

These control sentences are purely for ornamental performance of the judge line
because they do not affect the (spatial and temporal) arrangement of notes.
The expressions are mappings on [0, 1], and the mapped values are lengths in unit of pixels.

`SPACE_Y` is the vertical position of the judge line.
Positive values mean to place the judge line at specified number of pixels above the default position.
Default: `0`.

`WIDTH` is the width of the judge line. Default: `1`.

`HEIGHT` is the height of the judge line. Default: `voicesHeight` times the number of voices.

##### `RED`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`, `ALPHA`

Syntax:

```text
RED <expression>
GREEN <expression>
BLUE <expression>
ALPHA <expression>
```

Here `<expression>` is a single-variable mathematical expression of variable `x`.
See [math expressions](#math-expressions).

These control sentences are also purely for ornamental performance of the judge line.
They are used to change the color of the judge line.
These expressions are mappings from [0, 1] to [0, 1], and the default of them are all `1`
(pure and non-transparent white).

##### Math expressions

Some of the control sentences above use math expressions as parameters.
Parsing the math expressions are powered by [math.js](https://mathjs.org/).

In these expressions, there should be only one variable `x`, denoting the position in the row.
The position is measured according to notes' literal length but not their temporal length.

There is an `if` function that can be used to help express piecewise functions.
Its syntax is
```text
if(<condition1>, <value1>[, <condition2>, <value2>[, ... ]][, <elseValue>])
```
It is the same as
```text
condition1 ? value1 : condition2 ? value2 : ... : elseValue
```
All variables set by the gamer in preferences can be used in the math expressions:

| Variable                 | Meaning                                   | Type     | Default              |

Note that here the strings are 7-character lower-case hexadecimal notation of colors.
To get the RGB values (in [0, 1]), you can use the methods `red()`, `green()`, `blue()`.
For example, `'#4c8cff'.red()` returns approximately `0.298`, which is `0x4c / 0xff`. 

#### How to write a note

The syntax of a note is:

```text
<noteLength><dots><multiplicity><hold><tied>
```

| Element        | Possible value (Regexp) | Meaning                                                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `noteLength`   | `[0-9a-z]`              | The note length (without of augmentation dots)                           |
| `dots`         | `\.*`                   | The number of augmentation dots (as many as the number written here)     |
| `multiplicity` | `[0-9a-z]?`             | The multiplicity (number of simultaneous notes) (default 1 if omitted)   |
| `hold`         | `_?`                    | Whether the note is a hold (omitted underscore means a click)            |
| `tied`         | `~?`                    | Whether the note is tied (connected to the next note) (tilde means tied) |

Here the `noteLength` and the `multiplicity` are specified by a single character representing a number.
0–9 are just literally 0–9, and a–z are 10–35 respectively.

The `noteLength` value represents the log2 of the ratio of
the time length of a whole note and that of the specified note. 

The `multiplicity` value represents the number of simultaneous notes in the voices.
A zero multiplicity means that the note is a rest.

Because there are totally 10 digits and 26 letters,
the shortest possible note is `2**35`th note,
and the largest multiplicity is 35.

If a note's previous note is tied to this note, this note's `multiplicity` and `hold`
are useless and are kept consistent with the previous note.

#### Making notes beamed or grouping (contrametric)

Notes can be **beam**ed (flags are connected) by enclosing them with parentheses.
Parenthesized notes without flags will not be beamed.

Beams can be created across bar lines (by inserting `|` between beamed notes)
but not across rows or voices.

**Grouping**s (tuplets) can be created by specifying a ratio after the closing parenthesis.
The ratio consists of two characters, each of which is within `[0-9a-z]` representing a number.
The first number divided by the second number is
the ratio of the seeming length of the grouping and the actual length of the grouping.
The second number can be omitted, and the default value of it is
```js
ratio2 = 2**(floor(log2(ratio1)))
```
where `ratio1` is the first number.

Here is an example of some notes and the rhythm they represent:

```text
2 (3 3 3)3 2 (4 4 4 4 4)5 | 2
```
![\new RhythmicStaff {
\clef percussion
\time 4/4
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 80
c4 \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
c4 \tuplet 5/4 { c16 c c c c }
c4
}](https://upload.wikimedia.org/score/1/e/1ea3xyusyw770pzh5dli2ezzv76si3k/1ea3xyus.png)

#### Writing bar lines

Bar lines are created by inserting a `|` (and spaces for separating it from notes) within a voice.
They can appear within a beamed group of notes.
They can also appear between two tied notes.
It is recommended to write a bar line at the end of each voice.

Every bar line will extend all across the voices in the row
but not just the voice where it is written.

## How to publish a beatmap

There is currently no official way of publishing a beatmap.
Beatmappers have to publish their beatmaps on their own.
